# ProTracker Replay Code
ProTracker Replay v2.3a

Essentially the original ProTracker replay but with a few fixes and some minor optimisations.

This is in no way a fast replay, if you're looking for CPU Cycles, check out LSP, P61 and PHX.

It is meant to be just an accurate replay which ensures all those weird edge cases are supported.

Thats all.
